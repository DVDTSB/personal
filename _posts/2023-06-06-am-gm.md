Before anything let's start with a basic fact:

>**Squares Lemma**
>$x^2\geq0$ for all real $x$, with equality $\iff x=0$

**Proof:** you can do it! i believe in you!

And some definitions:

> **Definition of the Arihmetic Mean**
> The arihmetic mean of $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ is equal to $$\frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}$$


> **Definition of the Geometric Mean**
> The arihmetic mean of $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ is equal to $$\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}$$

Using the first fact we have:
$$(a-b)^2\geq 0 \iff a^2+b^2\geq 2ab$$

We just discovered:
> **Two Variable AM-GM**
> For any two positive reals $a$ and $b$ we have: $$\frac{a+b}{2}\geq \sqrt{ab}$$
> with equality $\iff a=b$

This is pretty nice actually, we can now prove a bunch of other things:
> **Exercise 1** Let $a$ be a positive real. Prove $$a+\frac{1}{a}\geq 2$$

**Proof:** By AM-GM we have $$a+\frac{1}{a}\geq 2\sqrt{a\cdot\frac{1}{a}}=2$$ with equality when $a=\cfrac{1}{a}\iff a=1$.

> **Exercise 2** Let $a,b,c$ be positive reals. Prove $$a^2+b^2+c^2 \geq ab+bc+ca$$
 
**Proof:** Notice that by AM-GM we have:
$$\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}\geq ab$$
$$\frac{b^2+c^2}{2}\geq bc$$
$$\frac{c^2+a^2}{2}\geq ca$$
By suming the above inequalities we get the desired result. Notice that the equality case for each of the above inequalities are $a=b, b=c, c=a \iff a=b=c$.

> **Exercise 3** Prove that for any positive reals $a,b$ we have $$a^4+b^4\geq a^3b+b^3a$$

**Proof:** Let's use AM-GM very carefully:
$$\begin{align*}
a^4+b^4 & = \frac{a^4+b^4}{2}+\frac{a^4+b^4}{2} \\
& \geq \frac{a^4+b^4}{2}+a^2b^2 \\
& = \frac{a^4+a^2b^2}{2}+\frac{b^4+a^2b^2}{2} \\
& \geq a^3b+b^3a
\end{align*}$$
