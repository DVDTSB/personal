Before anything let's start with a basic fact:

>**Squares Lemma**
>$x^2\geq0$ for all real $x$, with equality $\iff x=0$

**Proof:** you can do it! i believe in you!

And some definitions:

> **Definition of the Arihmetic Mean**
> The arihmetic mean of $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ is equal to $$\frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}$$


> **Definition of the Geometric Mean**
> The arihmetic mean of $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ is equal to $$\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}$$

Using the first fact we have:
$$(a-b)^2\geq 0 \iff a^2+b^2\geq 2ab$$

We just discovered:
> **Two Variable AM-GM**
> For any two positive reals $a$ and $b$ we have: $$\frac{a+b}{2}\geq \sqrt{ab}$$
> with equality $\iff a=b$
