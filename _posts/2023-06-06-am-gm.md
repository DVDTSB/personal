Before anything let's start with some facts:

>**Squares Lemma**
$x^2\geq0$ for all real $x$, with equality $\iff x=0$
>
**Proof:** you can do it! i believe in you!

> **Definition of the Arihmetic Mean**
The arihmetic mean of $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ is equal to $$\frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}$$


> **Definition of the Geometric Mean**
The arihmetic mean of $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ is equal to $$\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}$$
